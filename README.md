# Junior Caucus Website

Welcome to the Junior Caucus Website! This website is bootstrapped off of the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:
```bash
npm start
```

Starts the development server. 
```bash
npm run build
```

Bundles the app into static files for production. 
```bash
npm test
```

Starts the test runner. 
```bash
npm run eject
```

Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing: 
```bash
cd junior_website

npm start
```
